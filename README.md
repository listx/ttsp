# ttsp: Tokyo Train Station theme for Pidgin

This is a Pidgin port of the Adium sound theme called ["Tokyo Train Station"](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=602) (v1.5, 2004-09-12) by Dominik Dimaano (mroTobo@optonline.net (is this purposely garbled against spambots?)), known as "MrRoboto" in the Adium community.

# Installation

## Linux

Do the following:

	cd ~/.purple/themes
	ln -s /path/to/ttsp

. It should now show up in your pidgin preferences.

# License?

As the original theme does not include any sort of license, so this theme does not have a license, either.
